_At [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) we use [Contentful](https://contentful.com) as the CMS of choice for many of our web projects. Over time our use cases have become more complex and we've needed ways to enhance the editing experience for our content creators. Contentful allows us to customize and extend the functionality of the entry editor through [UI extensions](https://github.com/contentful/ui-extensions-sdk). Extensions can be custom user interface controls for fields (such as a dropdown) or help with workflows, data management and integrations._

## Development

This [quick introduction](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/uiextensions/) is a good place to get started with UI extensions. For more advanced and creative use cases, read this [blog post](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2017/10/09/creating-ui-extensions-with-contentful/).

### API Reference

Refer to the [official SDK documentation](https://github.com/contentful/ui-extensions-sdk/blob/master/docs/ui-extensions-sdk-frontend.md#extensionspace) for a list of available methods. You can also look through the existing extension files for inspiration.

### Getting started

We use [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [`yarn` workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) under the hood to make developing and publishing our extensions a breeze. After you first clone the repo, you probably want to [bootstrap](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#bootstrap) all packages for development. Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

This command will install the dependencies for all packages and link any cross-dependencies.

### Creating a new extension

You can quickly bootstrap a new UI extension by running this command in the project root:

```bash
npm run create:extension <EXTENSION_ID> "<EXTENSION_NAME>" <EXTENSION_TEMPLATE>
```

This will create a new folder `./packages/<EXTENSION_ID>` with all the files your extension needs. The command will also install the basic dependencies for your extension, so you can jump straight into development.

The extension UI goes inside `./src/index.html`. The logic lives inside `./src/index.js`. Any custom styles can be added to `./src/index.scss`, although the default styles provided by Contentful should be sufficient.

Two different **extension templates** are available: [**basic**](https://github.com/sumup/contentful-extensions/tree/master/templates/basic) (default) includes the above mentioned files. [**preact**](https://github.com/sumup/contentful-extensions/tree/master/templates/preact) extends the base template with — you guessed it — [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) for easier state management and DOM updates.

### Local dev

We use [`gulp`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to build, bundle and serve all code. Styles are written in SASS and JavaScript in ES6+. To start a development server with automatic reloading, run the following command inside your extension folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server is created by [`BrowserSync`](https://github.com/Browsersync/browser-sync), which generates a self-signed certificate to enable a secure `https` connection. This is important to get the extensions to work with Contentful's CSP policy. The first time you load the extension, you will likely get a security error. Simply add an exception for this certificate.

### Publishing to Contentful

During development, the extension is served from `https://localhost:1234`. Once your extension is finished, you can publish it to Contentful by running the following command inside your extension folder:

```bash
npm run cf:create --space-id <SPACE_ID> --environment-id <ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

After you've published your extensions to a Contentful space for the first time, you need to run the following command in your extension folder to push any changes:

```bash
npm run cf:update --space-id <SPACE_ID> --environment-id <ENVIRONMENT_ID> --version <VERSION>
```

Both commands will bundle your code and upload it to the Contentful space and environment you specified.

Visit the [Contentful CLI docs](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/extension) for more up-to-date instructions to publish, update or manage the UI extensions on Contentful.
